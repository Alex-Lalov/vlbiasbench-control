# vlbiasbench-control
Public repository for DSAIT4205 Fundamental Research in Machine Learning featuring a control dataset for VLBiasBench

All of the images in the `data/` directory will be noised and placed in the `noisy/` directory; simply run `python main.py`.
The python dependencies are in requirements.txt and it is recommended to use python 3.10.4 and execute the script while your working directory is the root of the repository.

### Warning 
This repo includes the images and data since they are not substantially large
